// The design and implementation of this light module, which includes
// lights, light, and triple, was originally contributed for SDL 1.2
// by Sean Kelly, Spring 2013.  The inspiration for the module was from 
// Dr. Geist's graphics course, CpSc 405.
// The module was updated for SDL 2.0 by Brian and Chris Malloy.
// Brian and Chris also eliminated the dependence on open mp and
// on the gfx library; thus, no additional libraries are necessary
// to install and run this module.
